# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Usage

The work day scheduler is a daily planner to create a schedule.
When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
Below time blocks for standard business hours will display.
When the time blocks for that day are viewed, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user may add an event by clicking on the time block. The user can then save their entry which is then saved to local storage. When the page is refreshed the entries remain.
